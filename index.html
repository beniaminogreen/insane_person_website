            <p>You have just been caught looking in my window! While I
            appreciate your interest, I’d like to gently remind you of a few
            things:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                        <p> <b> The window is for my enjoyment: </b> When I was looking for
                        an apartment, I specifically asked for one with a window so I could
                        enjoy the view from outside. When you take the opportunity to look
                        in, you are freeloading on my hard work and accumen. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                        <p> <b> The window is designed to be one-way: </b> The window is
                        designed to be a one-way portal to the outer world. When you look
                        in at me from the window, you are perverting its purpose. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p> <b> Orwellian Vibes: </b> When you peek through my window, I start feeling like Winston Smith from <i>1984</i>. Remember, Big Brother isn’t watching you—I'm just trying to enjoy my privacy without feeling like I'm on a reality TV show. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

<p>In spite of these remiders, I recognize that some people may not be able to supress the urge to look. If this describes you, please keep in mind the following guidelines as you peek:</p>

<div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Do:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Wear sunglasses</b> to keep your peeping incognito.</li>
          <li><b>Don’t use flash:</b> Never use a camera flash or bright lights that might expose your presence.</li>
          <li><b>Respect property boundaries:</b> Stay within public areas and avoid trespassing.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Don’t:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Use a telescope;</b> it’s too obvious.</li>
          <li><b>Don’t peek into sensitive areas:</b> Avoid peeking into private spaces like bathrooms or bedrooms.</li>
          <li><b>Don’t ignore reactions:</b> If I catch you peeking, you have to leave immediately.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>

<div class="container">
    Thank you for your understanding and respect regarding these peeping guidelines. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated and helps everyone maintain their privacy and peace of mind. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.
